### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

## About
My name is **Danil**. I live in **Saint Petersburg**. I don't work anywhere at the moment, so if there is a job, invite me, I will be glad. (github written with **Google Translate**).

I'm a driven front-end developer who strives to create something unique and cool. I studied to be a system administrator, and then improved my knowledge on a course from Yandex Praktikum.

## My Projects
# ðŸ“± RP-loyal (current)
At the moment I am developing my own project __RP-loyal__ (the name is not final yet). It is a special messenger for conducting RP.

I dedicate all my free time to it. You can find two repositories in my profile.

But I will still do it for you ðŸ˜„

Here is the [frontend](https://github.com/Silence1sGolden/rp-loyal) part and here is the [backend](https://github.com/Silence1sGolden/rp-loyal-server)

# FlipCatFlop (finished)
__FlipCatFlop__ is the very first website I ever wrote (a working website with meaning).

I also have it in my repositories ([here it is](https://github.com/Silence1sGolden/FlipCatFlop))

There is no point in writing much about it, it is a simple site written in default JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Super simple, but WORKING site, I am also proud of it)))
